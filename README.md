## Abstract

Voter turnout rate, a representation of the percentage of actual voters out of the voting-eligible population, is a crucial factor that informs election outcomes, political campaign strategies, and policy matters. While discussion of the demographic factors that influence an individual‚Äôs chance of voting is prevalent, quantitative knowledge of the socioeconomic factors that contribute to a given state‚Äôs voter turnout would allow presidential campaigns to determine which states are most worth targeting. By analyzing an aggregated dataset that includes violent crime rate, Human Development Index, partisan control of state government, median income, unemployment rate, and Gini coefficient for all fifty states in presidential election years from 2000 to 2020, we hope to determine the magnitude of influence that these factors have on the voter turnout rate in any given state. We employ machine learning techniques such as LASSO, xGBoost, ARIMA, and a relaxed linear regression to develop a model that can predict voter turnout by state for presidential elections using quantitative data on these socioeconomic factors. While our ultimate goal is to predict voter turnout for the 2024 presidential election, this research can also serve as a stepping stone to improving voter turnout rates, a necessary step to ensure a thriving democracy.


## What are the 4 Models?

LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regression model that can be used to narrow down coefficients for feature selection. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an ensemble learning model that builds decision trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects errors made by the previous ones. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a deep learning model that consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, which automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a time series forecasting model that combines three components: autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA). ARIMA models are effective for predicting future points in a series based on past data.

This research was done under professor Linda Zhao at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
